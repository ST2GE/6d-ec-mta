## interface for gta san andreas: multi theft auto & mta
### help on installing the interface
> - before unpacking files with replacement, make a backup copy of the files!
> 
> 1. unzip the images in a path (with replacement):
> ```bash
> E:\mta\cgui\
> ```
> 
> - each has its own path where the mta directory is located.
> 2. move the directory to the specified path:
> ```bash
> E:\mta\skins
> ```
> 
> - will look something like this:
> > 1. Classic
> > 2. Default
> > 3. Lighter black
> > 4. inanis
> 
> 3. so we set the interface manually 👀️
> 4. launch the game and go to the game settings, click on the interface tab and select our skin:
> ```bash
> inanis
> ```
> 
> 5. apply and enjoy the game 😄
